    "- Scores predominantly cluster around the 3.5 to 4.5 range, suggesting that the majority of reviews are **favorable**. The histograms show a skew towards higher ratings, with fewer low scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ABV Distribution**\n",
    "- The `beer_abv` content is mostly concentrated in the lower range (approximately 5% to 10%), which aligns with the ABV of **common beer styles**. High ABV beers are present but significantly less common.\n",
    "\n",
    "**### ABV vs Review Scores**\n",
    "- The relationship between ABV and review scores does not show a distinct pattern, suggesting that beer strength does not solely influence its perceived quality. The diversity in scoring across ABV levels indicates that **other factors** may have a more substantial impact on reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Presence of Outliers** \n",

    "- Selecting Features for Clustering:\n",
    "    - We began by selecting the numerical features that will be used for clustering. These features include 'review_aroma', 'review_appearance', 'review_palate', 'review_taste', and 'beer_abv'. These features represent different aspects of beer reviews and characteristics.\n",
    "- Scaling Numerical Features:\n",
    "    - Before applying K-Means clustering, it is important to scale the numerical features to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the clustering process. We used the StandardScaler to scale the numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance.\n",
    "- Selecting the Number of Clusters (k):\n",
    "    - We determined the number of clusters (k) to use in the K-Means algorithm. In this case, we chose to use 5 clusters, but the number of clusters can be adjusted based on domain knowledge or using techniques such as the elbow method or silhouette score.\n",
    "- Performing K-Means Clustering:\n",
    "    - We applied the K-Means clustering algorithm to the scaled numerical features. K-Means partitions the dataset into k clusters based on the similarity of data points. Each cluster is represented by its centroid, and data points are assigned to the nearest centroid.\n",
    "- Adding Cluster Labels to the DataFrame:\n",
    "    - After clustering, we added the cluster labels assigned by the K-Means algorithm to the original DataFrame. These cluster labels indicate which cluster each data point belongs to and will be used for further analysis and interpretation.\n",
    "- Visualizing Clusters Using PCA:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and visualization of the clusters. PCA transforms the original data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving the variance of the data. We visualized the clusters in a 2D scatter plot using the first two principal components to understand the distribution of data points in the reduced space.\n",
    "- Visualizing Clusters in 3D:\n",
    "    - Additionally, we performed PCA with three components to visualize the clusters in a 3D scatter plot. This provides a more comprehensive view of the clusters, allowing us to explore the data in three dimensions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "By completing this clustering analysis, we aim to uncover underlying patterns or structures in the beer review dataset. These insights can be valuable for various applications, such as targeted marketing, product recommendations, or customer segmentation."
